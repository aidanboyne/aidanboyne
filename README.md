Welcome!

I'm a bioengineering and math undergrad student at UCLA currently working on computational thyroid models under Dr. Joe DiStefano. I previously worked with Dr. Guillaume Chanfreau conducting research on RNA splicing and optimizing COMPASS, a splice site identificaiton pipeline created by previous PhD student Dr. Kevin Roy. I've also interned at ZS associates where I worked on database construction and visualization.

Outside of work and school, my personal projects include creating directed graphs for both disease target exploration and to uncover interesting culinary combinations using the Resource Description Framework (RDF) .
