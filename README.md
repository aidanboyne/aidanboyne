Welcome!

I'm a bioengineering and math undergrad student at UCLA currently working on computational thyroid models under Dr. Joe DiStefano. I previously worked with Dr. Guillaume Chanfreau conducting research on RNA splicing and am optimizing COMPASS, a splice site identificaiton pipeline created by previous PhD student Dr. Kevin Roy and intern at ZS associates where I worked on database construction and visualization.

Outside of work and school, my personal projects include creating directed graph for disease exploration using data formatted using the Resource Description Framework (RDF). The goal is to create a tighly connected inner core of data surrouned by a sparse web of potential connections to leverage the power of inferencing engines and discover new possiblities.
