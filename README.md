Welcome!
===

I'm a medical student at BCM but still like to code on the side. I studied bioengineering and math in undergrad where I researched computational thyroid models under Dr. Joe DiStefano. Previously, I've worked with Dr. Guillaume Chanfreau conducting research on RNA splicing and optimizing COMPASS, a splice site identificaiton pipeline created by previous PhD student Dr. Kevin Roy. I've also interned at ZS associates where I worked on database construction and visualization.
