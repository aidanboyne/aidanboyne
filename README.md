Welcome!

I'm a bioengineering and math undergrad student at UCLA and associate intern at ZS associates. I currently work with Dr. Guillaume Chanfreau conducting research on RNA splicing and am optimizing COMPASS, a splice site identificaiton pipeline created by previous PhD student Dr. Kevin Roy.

Outside of work and school, my personal projects include creating directed graph for disease exploration using data formatted using the Resource Description Framework (RDF). The goal is to create a tighly connected inner core of data surrouned by a sparse web of potential connections to leverage the power of inferencing engines and discover new possiblities.
